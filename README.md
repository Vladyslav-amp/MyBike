# MyBike

MyBike landing its design from Figma. This simply page which present modern e-bike technology. In HTML i have everything divided into the appropriate sections, which makes it easier to find a single piece of code. SASS divided into separate folder (ex. Header style in Header folder, #section_name style in #section_name folder) - its good way for styling, easy navigate in different folders(.scss) you need.
I used BEM methodology in my page, also i adhered to clean and readable code. SCSS (SASS) help me to optimize my styles(incl. mixins for adaptive design).
